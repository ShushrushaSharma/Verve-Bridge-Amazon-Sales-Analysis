This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Amazon sales and fashion data. The project involves importing and cleaning the datasets, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying trends and patterns. Key steps include handling mixed data types, dealing with missing values, converting date columns to datetime format, and extracting meaningful features like year and month. Various visualizations such as line plots, bar graphs, and heatmaps are generated to illustrate monthly and yearly sales trends, as well as correlation analysis. The scripts also include a custom function to summarize key statistical metrics for any specified column.
